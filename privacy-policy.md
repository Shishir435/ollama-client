## üìÑ Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 5, 2025

Thank you for using the Ollama Client browser extension (‚ÄúExtension‚Äù). Your privacy and security are important to us. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how the Extension operates, and how we protect your data.

### 1. Information We Collect

- The Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII)** from users.
- No data is sent to external servers or third-party services by this Extension.
- Any data processed (e.g., chat inputs and model responses) remains **locally on your device**.

### 2. How the Extension Works

- The Extension acts as a client interface to communicate with **locally hosted large language models (LLMs)** via the Ollama platform.
- All AI model interactions, including message processing and generation, occur **entirely on your machine**, through Ollama‚Äôs local API.
- The Extension supports multiple models such as Gemma, LLaMA 2, Mistral, CodeLLaMA, and others installed locally.
- User chat history and session data are stored locally in **browser storage or IndexedDB**. Users have full control and may delete saved sessions at any time.
- The Extension uses **Declarative Net Request (DNR) API** to bypass CORS restrictions, eliminating the need for users to modify backend CORS settings in most cases (effective from v0.1.3).

### 3. Permissions and Data Access

- The Extension requests only the minimal necessary permissions, including:

  - Access to tabs and active browser context to enable content extraction from webpages and improve usability.
  - Localhost communication to interface with the Ollama API.

- It does **not** access personal data unrelated to its functionality (e.g., browsing history, cookies).
- No third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services are integrated.

### 4. Data Storage and Retention

- By default, the Extension stores chat sessions locally in the browser‚Äôs IndexedDB using Dexie for efficient and reliable storage.

- Users have full control and can delete saved chats at any time through the Extension‚Äôs interface.

- No chat data is synced, backed up, or transmitted externally.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as our Extension evolves. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the Extension after updates constitutes acceptance of the changes.
